    "# Alpha and Beta Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "Different higher-level measures are often used to describe the microbiome in a sample. These do not provide information on changes in the abundance of specific taxa but allow us to access a broader change or difference in the composition of microorganisms. Alpha and beta diversity are examples of such measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different measures exist to estimate diversity within a single sample, jointly called alpha diversity. The different measures reflect the richness (number) or distribution (evenness) of a microbial sample or aim to reflect a combination of both properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rarefaction curves are often used when calculating alpha diversity indices because increasing numbers of sequenced taxa allow increasingly accurate estimates of total population diversity. Rarefaction curves can therefore be used to estimate the full sample richness, as compared to the observed sample richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "While alpha diversity is a measure of microbiome diversity applicable to a single sample, beta diversity is a measure of the similarity or dissimilarity of two communities. As for alpha diversity, many indices exist, each reflecting different aspects of community heterogeneity. Key differences relate to how the indices value variation in rare species if they consider presence/absence only or incorporate abundance, and how they interpret shared absence. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is a popular measure that considers both size (overall abundance per sample) and shape (abundance of each taxon) of the communities (Bray, 1957). Beta diversity is an essential measure for many popular statistical methods in ecology, such as ordination-based methods, and is widely used for studying the association between environmental variables and microbial composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, alpha diversity measures can be seen as a summary statistic of a single population (within-sample diversity), while beta diversity measures are estimates of similarity or dissimilarity between populations (between samples).\n",
